                      This project was implemented as a part of the course Recommender Systems and Web Mining. Using the data from Food.com,
                      the first task was to predict whether a user would cook a recipe. Since data only consisted of entries where user had cooked a recipe 
                      and given it some rating, for this task I performed negative sampling from the given dataset. Subsequently, I split
                      the data into train and test set and using feature ablation studies I fit a logistic regression model on the test data using inbuilt 
                      Python library. The accuracy achieved for this task was ~70%. <br>
                      The second task was to predict the rating a user would give a recipe. For this task, I fit a latent factor model on the given 
                      dataset yielding a Mean Squared Error ~0.8. <br>
                      The solutions to both the tasks had to be uploaded on Kaggle (Username: Juzer Golwala)

                        I designed a multi-threaded graph analytics system modeled on Google’s Pregel. Given a graph, the system calculates the PageRank of all the vertices. The communication between vertices is achieved using message queues and synchronization using cyclic barriers.

                        I built a distributed word-count system consisting of master and many worker nodes. The master manages the workers - spawns/re-spawns them; does fault-tolerance by sending heartbeat messages every 3 seconds; and renders the final output. The workers communicate with master using sockets.

                        I created a simple search engine comprising of web-crawler, parser, indexer, tf-idf and PageRank, and MongoDB. The crawled pages were parsed using filtering techniques like stemming, stop word removal, etc. I used Cloudera VM running Hadoop MapReduce to index the pages. Ranking was then done using a combination of tf-idf and PageRank. The project was also deployed on an AWS EC2 instance using DynamoDb and S3 file storage.

I employed socket programming and Plotly's JavaScript API to achieve data communication and visualization respectively.

We used 512-bit RSA key pair, MD-5 hashing, X.509v1 certificates, encrypted timestamps and session keys for ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. We added One time password (OTP) as a second layer of authentication. Email and message notifications were also enabled.

Access to modify is restricted to the owner of that particular restaurant.

Simulation of the project was done on GENI testbed to get real-time performance analysis.

                        I collaborated on the design of an autonomous robot which fetches objects upon a voice or text command. The objects and their locations are pre-fed into a library. So on the command the robot moves towards the object's location and on reaching it an on board camera starts taking images of the location, simultaneously comparing it with already stored images of the object. Upon successful comparison the robot activates a mechanical gripper which then extends towards the object and fetches it. Once the object is gripped it traces the path back to the user along with the object.
